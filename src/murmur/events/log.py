"""LogEventEmitter — the always-on default emitter (structlog backend).

Forwards each :class:`RuntimeEvent` to structlog at INFO level (or ERROR
for the failure variants) so observability lands in whatever sink the
host has configured for stdlib / structlog. The event's ``payload`` is
flattened into the log entry's keyword args; ``timestamp`` /
``trace_id`` / ``parent_trace_id`` / ``agent_name`` / ``task_id`` are
emitted as top-level fields so log-search backends can filter on them.

Wired in by default — see :class:`murmur.AgentRuntime`. Combine with
:class:`MultiEventEmitter` to add SSE / custom sinks alongside.

Implementation notes:

- The emit path is ``await log.ainfo(...)`` / ``await log.aerror(...)``
  so it's safe inside async code without blocking the event loop.
- We deliberately do **not** raise from emit — a logging sink that
  raises would take an agent run down with it. Errors during emission
  are swallowed and logged via structlog's own error handling.
